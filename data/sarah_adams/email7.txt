Hi Sarah,
We're hosting a family-friendly outdoor workshop focusing on nature appreciation. Join us for a day of fun activities, including hiking, nature crafts, and educational sessions in the Texas Hill Country.
It's an opportunity for families to connect with nature. Would your family like to participate?
Best regards,
The Outdoor Workshops Team
